README for dvm-dos-tem
===========================================

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.svg)](https://gitter.im/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Basic information is provided in this README file. For more details, see the 
wiki: [](https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem/wiki)

The dvm-dos-tem (`dvmdostem`) is a process based bio-geo-chemical ecosystem 
model.

There are two primary ways in which you might interact with `dvmdostem`: 
performing an _extrapolation_, or performing a _calibration_. 

When performing an extrapolation the program progresses to completion,
typically over one or more spatial locations (multiple cohorts, or grid cells). 
The outputs are typically analyzed only once the simulation has completed for 
all time-steps and spatial locations.

Calibrations are performed for a single spatial location (a single 
cohort or grid cell). For calibration, we currently have two approaches: 

1. manual calibration
2. machine learning assisted calibration

Most of our tooling was originally developed for the manual approach to
calibration, and we have since adapted it to be usable under the guidance of 
machine learning algorithms.

Under a manual calibration, you will evaluate the simulation as it progresses, 
pause the simulation to adjust parameters by hand, and then resume the
simulation while keeping an eye on the model outputs with respect to the 
calibration target values.

Our current machine-learning assisted calibration process uses an external 
software called [PEST](http://www.pesthomepage.org), which will automatically
adjust parameters, and compute a final metric denoting how close the model
outputs are to our calibration targets.

There is more information concerning calibration in the `calibration/` 
directory.


Requirements and Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main program

The following tools/libraries are necessary in order to compile and run `dvm-dos-tem`. 

* [Boost](http://www.boost.org), at least v1.54 (when Boost::Log was added)
  - [Boost::Program_options](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/program_options/)
  - [Boost::Filesystem](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/filesystem/)
  - [Boost::Thread](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/thread/)
  - [Boost.Log](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/log/)
  - [Boost.System](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/system/)
* [Jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)
* [GNU Readline](https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html#TOCDocumentation)
* [PThread](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/libpthread.html)
* [LAPACKE](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
* [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)

* MPI - included in the Makefile and SConstruct, but not used yet. Will be needed as we implement parallelism.

## Auxillary pre- and post-processing tools

* Python
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - netCDF4

* GDAL Command Line Tools

Downloading 
-----------------------------------------------------------
We (the Spatial Ecology Lab) are maintaining the main fork of dvm-dos-tem on 
Github: [https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem](https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem)

The dvm-dos-tem program is not distributed as a binary file, so to run the 
program, you must download the source code and compile it yourself. 

 * The `master` branch will always contain the latest production version of the
model. 
 * The `devel` branch will contain recent developments to the code. We try to 
 maintain a stable `devel` branch: the code merged into `devel` should always compile 
 and run, and typically has been reviewed by or discussed with several people in 
 the lab.
 
We are using Github's Pull Requests to manage contributins to the code.


Compiling / Building
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have two options for compling the source code:

 * make (and Makefile)
 * scons (and SConstruct file)
 
`Make` is a old, widely availabe, powerful program with a somewhat arcane syntax. 
The Makefile is not setup for partial-compilation, so editing a single file 
requires and re-making the project will result in re-compiling every single
file. This can be annoyingly slow if you find yourself compiling frequently.

`Scons` is a build program that is written in Python, and designed to be a easier
to use than make. The `scons` and the SConstruct file are smart enough to do
partial builds, so that some changes result in much faster builds.

Both programs can take a flag specifying parallel builds and the number of 
processors to use (e.g.: `-j4`) for parallel builds.

This project requires a number of libraries are installed and available on your 
path. For a complete list, see the install commands in `bootstrap-system.sh`

If you have all the requsite libraries installed and available on your path, 
then either of these commands should work:

    $ make

or 

    $ scons

### Notes on build environments
    
There are some helpful scripts provided in the `env-setup-scripts/` folder that will set
a few environment variables for you for specific systems. For instance on atlas, the
correct version of NetCDF is not provided as a system package, but the user tobey has
made it available so that you don't have to compile it yourself. You must set an
environment variable so that when you compile and run it will look in tobey's directory
for the NetCDF library files.

You can either remember to run the setup commands/script each time you logon to the
computer where are you are interacting with the model or add a line to your `~/.bashrc`
or `~/.bash_profile` that "sources" the setup script. This makes sure the setup commands
are run each time you log on. 
E.g.

    $ vim ~/.bash_profile
    # Add a line like this at the end:
    source /path/to/your/dvm-dos-tem/env-setup-scripts/setup-env-for-aeshna.sh
    
If you are successful getting dvm-dos-tem to compile and run on a different system
it would be appreciated if you submit the appropriate setup commands so that other's
don't have to spend time figuring out those details.

Running 
---------------------------------------------

Running `dvmdostem` (operating the model) requires 3 types of "input" information:

1. Driving data (input data)
2. Parameter values
3. Configuration options (from command line or config file)

Some demonstration driving data is provided in the `demo-data/` directory.
We maintain a library of driving inputs separately from the git repository
that manages the `dvmdostem` code base. There is a script (`update-mirror.sh`)
in the `scripts/` directory that you can use to maintain a mirror of the 
input library. Sample parameters are provided in the `parameters/` directory, 
and sample configuraiton options are provided in the `config/` directory. More 
configuration options are available via options supplied on the command line
when starting the program. The `--help` flag provides some info and shows the
defaults:

    $ ./dvmdostem -h
      -c [ --cal-mode ]                     Switch for calibration mode. When this 
                                            flag is present, the program will be 
                                            forced to run a single site and with 
                                            '--loop-order=space-major'. The program
                                            will generate yearly and monthly 
                                            '.json' files in your /tmp  directory 
                                            that are intended to be read by other 
                                            programs or scripts.
      --last-n-json arg (=-1)               Only output the json files for the last
                                            N years. -1 indicates to output all 
                                            years. This is useful for running with 
                                            PEST, where we do need the json files 
                                            (and calibration mode), but PEST only 
                                            looks at the last year, so we can save 
                                            a lot of effort and only write out the 
                                            last file. Made this option 
                                            configurable so that we can write out a
                                            number of files, in case we need to do 
                                            some averaging over the last few years 
                                            for PEST.
      -u [ --pid-tag ] arg                  Use the process ID (passed as an 
                                            argmument) to tag the output cal json 
                                            directories. Facilitates parallel runs,
                                            but may make the calibration-viewer.py 
                                            more difficult to work with (must 
                                            pass/set the PID tag so that the 
                                            calibration-viewer.py knows where to 
                                            find the json files.)
      -p [ --pr-yrs ] arg (=10)             Number or PRE RUN years to run.
      -e [ --eq-yrs ] arg (=1000)           Number of EQUILIBRIUM years to run.
      -s [ --sp-yrs ] arg (=100)            Number of SPINUP years to run.
      -t [ --tr-yrs ] arg (=0)              Number of TRANSIENT years to run.
      -n [ --sc-yrs ] arg (=0)              Number of SCENARIO years to run.
      -o [ --loop-order ] arg (=space-major)
                                            Which control loop is on the outside: 
                                            'space-major' or 'time-major'. For 
                                            example 'space-major' means 'for each 
                                            cohort, for each year'.
      -f [ --ctrl-file ] arg (=config/config.js)
                                            choose a control file to use
      -l [ --log-level ] arg (=warn)        Control the verbositiy of the console 
                                            log statements. Choose one of the 
                                            following: debug, info, note, warn, 
                                            err, fatal.
      --log-scope arg (=all)                Control the scope of log messages: 
                                            yearly, monthly, or daily. With a 
                                            setting of M (monthly), messages within
                                            the monthly (and yearly) scope will be 
                                            shown, but not messages within the 
                                            daily scope. Values other than 'Y', 
                                            'M', 'D', or 'all' will be ignored. 
                                            Scopes are determined by 'boost log 
                                            named scopes' set within the source 
                                            code.
      -x [ --fpe ]                          Switch for enabling floating point 
                                            exceptions. If present, the program 
                                            will crash when NaN or Inf are 
                                            generated.
      -h [ --help ]                         produces helps message, then quits

### Viewing model progress and results

Naturally after (or while) running `dvmdostem` you will want to view the model
outputs. Presently the best way to do this is with the `calibration-viewer.py`
program. The calibration viewer is designed to display data that `dvmdostem`
writes to `.json` files. As evidenced by the name, the `calibration-viewer.py`
was originally written to enable manual calibration of the model, but it is
usable for general viewing purposes. The general idea is that as the model runs
it will write date out to `.json` files that are stored in a user-configurable
location. Then the `calibration-viewer.py` program will look for the `.json`
files and display them. See the `--help` flag for many options availble when 
using the viewer.


Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There is a Doxygen file (Doxyfile) included with this project. The current settings are
for the Doxygen output to be generated in the `docs/dvm-dos-tem/` directory.

The file is setup to build a very comprehensive set of documents, including as many
diagrams as possible (call graphs, dependency diagrams, etc). To build the diagrams,
Doxygen requires a few extra packages, such as the dot package. This is not available on
`aeshna`, so running Doxygen on `aeshna` will produce a bunch of errors.

Developing 
----------------------------------------------------
This project is maintained using Git (an open source distributed version control system)
and Github (a web service that provides hosting for code projects and has tools and idioms
for collaborative working on code-related projects).

This project is maintained using the "Fork and Pull" workflow. For more 
on git, forking, pulling, etc, see the wiki.

### Branching Model

The SEL maintained repository for dvm-dos-tem uses two special branches: "`master`" and
"`devel`". The `master` branch is considered the main, stable trunk of the code base. Each
commit on the `master` branch is considered a "stable" release and will have a version
number associated with it. The `devel` branch is used for holding recent developments
that are ready to be shared amongst the SEL group, but for whatever the reason are not yet
fit for including in the next "version" (release) of the model.

Generally changes are made on topic branches. Then the person who does the change requests
that their modification be pulled into the SEL `devel` branch. Eventually when the group
is happy with the `devel` branch, it is merged into `master`, creating the next "version"
of dvm-dos-tem. This stable `master` branch is an integration point for other projects,
such as the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model project.

### Coding Style

> TODO: add coding style info...why important, standards, makes diffs easier to read etc.

* line width max 80 chars
* use spaces instead of tabs
* documentation: doxygen style comments
* commit messages...
* line endings...


### Workflow

This project is using the "Integration Manager" workflow described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
This means that to get started you should first "fork" the project from the 
github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.git repository. This will give you your own dvm-dos-tem
repository in your own github account (github.com/YOU/dvm-dos-tem.git). Next you will
"clone" from your account to your own machine (where ever you perform your coding work).
Finally when you have made changes on your own working machine you will "push" those
changes back to _your_ fork. If you would like the changes you made to be incorporated
into the shared project (github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.git), then issue a "pull request"
from your github account. This process is described in detail in the Tutorial
