# NOTES

This directory is for configuraiton files that can be 
copied into Docker images. Keeping files here prevents
the need to use things like HEREDOCS in Dockerfiles,
which as of 2021, was only recently introduced.

Examples of files that might be useful are:
.bashrc, jupyter and ipython config files, .vimrc, etc
